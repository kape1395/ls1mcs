<pre>                         WA8DED HOST MODE USER'S GUIDE
                         =============================</pre>

<pre>                Original by Paul T. Williamson, KB5MU,  23 May 1986
                Updated by Peter Guelzow, DB2OS,  8 Aug 1993
</pre>

<pre>  Abstract:  This  document  explains  the use of the WA8DED Host mode with 
WA8DED's AX25 Version 2 Multi-channel TNC Firmware, Version 1.1 for the TAPR 
TNC-1 and the TheFirmware TF Version 2.x for the TNC-2 by NORD&gt;&lt;LINK e.V.
TheFirmware TF is also available for the TNC-3 (68302) Hardware.</pre>

<pre>It  is based  on  the  information  provided in the WA8DED document (Version 1.0), 
the W6IXU mailbox software (13 May 1986 revision),  and  the  WA8DED  Split  
Screen Terminal  Emulator  (SS,  28 April 1986 version).  It is intended for use by an
application programmer attempting to communicate with the TNC in Host mode, and
assumes that the programmer is already familiar with user-mode operation of the
WA8DED firmware and TheFirmware.

</pre>

<pre>                                   Chapter 1
                              What Is Host Mode?
  WA8DED's TNC firmware provides two entirely independent user interfaces.  The
default  user  interface is designed for use by a human operator at a terminal.
Host mode, on the other hand, is  designed  for  use  by  a  specially-designed
computer  program.    It  allows the computer to maintain strict control of the
computer-TNC link, and to obtain control information that  would  otherwise  be
difficult to extract from the normal data stream.</pre>

<pre>  One  of  the most common bugaboos of computer-TNC interfacing has always been
flow control.  The TNC is capable of sending data faster than the computer  can
process  it,  and  likewise the computer is capable of sending data faster than
the TNC can transmit it.  It is theoretically possible to  solve  this  problem
with  either  hardware  flow  control  (RTS/CTS  wires  in  the RS-232 link) or
software flow control (XON/XOFF characters inserted in the data stream).   Both
of  these  methods  are tricky and error-prone, however.  Hardware flow control
may not always be available, and software flow  control,  even  when  it  works
adequately,  leads  to data transparency problems (i.e., what if the data being
transmitted contains XON or XOFF?).  If everything is not exactly  right,  data
will be lost.</pre>

<pre>  WA8DED's Host mode solves this problem by</pre>

<pre>   1. Speaking only when spoken to, and</pre>

<pre>   2. Limiting all data bursts to 256 bytes.</pre>

<pre>The  first  point  allows  the  computer  program to go off and do other things
(write data out to disk, handle the  console,  make  coffee)  without  worrying
about  data  coming  from  the TNC and dropping on the floor.  The second point
allows computers that have a hard time  handling  fast  serial  data  (e.g.,  a
Commodore  64  with no UART) to concentrate on the receiving task to fill a 256
byte buffer, then go off and process the data without worrying about additional
data  arriving  before  it has time to process that batch.  This scheme is very
forgiving of inefficient serial routines, so that faster computers can get away
with simple byte-level polling (e.g., a program for the IBM PC can use the BIOS
serial port routines).</pre>

<pre>  On the subject of serial routines, notice that the TNC does not handle either
hardware  or  software flow control when in Host mode.  You must make sure that
your serial drivers will not send unwanted XON and XOFF characters to the TNC.</pre>

<pre>  Since the TNC speaks only when spoken to, the computer must  constantly  poll
the  TNC  to  find  out what is happening on the link.  In user mode, connected
data received over the AX.25 link is immediately displayed (if that channel  is
selected).    In  Host  mode,  the  TNC  is  not  allowed  to  send information
unsolicited, so the program must ask the  TNC  for  data  periodically.    This
implies  that  the  computer-TNC  link will be busy most of the time.  Frequent
polling and a relatively high baud rate (say 4800 or 9600 baud)  are  desirable
for  applications that require quick response times.  A user monitoring data in
real time will notice delays if the delay between polls is too great.</pre>

<pre>  The format of these short computer-TNC exchanges is  carefully  specified  to
eliminate  ambiguity  and  minimize overhead.  The computer sends to the TNC in
the following format:</pre>

<pre>    {channel}{info/cmd}{count}{data...}</pre>

<pre>  Channel is the channel number to which the transmission pertains.    Info/cmd
distinguishes  between  information  to be transmitted and commands to be acted
upon by the TNC.  Count specifies the number of bytes to  follow,  and  Data...
are the actual data bytes or command bytes.  The details of this format will be
discussed later.  All computer-to-TNC transmissions must follow this format.</pre>

<pre>  The TNC sends to the computer one of several different formats:</pre>

<pre>    {channel}{code=0}                      short format</pre>

<pre>or</pre>

<pre>    {channel}{code=1-5}{data...}{0}        null-terminated format</pre>

<pre>or</pre>

<pre>    {channel}{code=6-7}{count}{data...}    byte-count format]</pre>

<pre>  Notice that you can always tell what is to follow  from  the  code  received.
The  last  format is very similar to the computer-to-TNC format. The details of
these formats will be described later.  All computer-to-TNC transmissions  will
follow one of these formats.

</pre>

<pre>                                   Chapter 2
                        Entering and Exiting Host Mode
  Host mode is entered by giving a JHOST 1 command to the TNC in the usual way.
This sounds simple enough.  Just send &lt;ESC&gt;JHOST1&lt;CR&gt; to the TNC.  But what  if
something  has  already  been sent to the TNC (say by powerup transients)?  The
&lt;ESC&gt; will be treated as data (echoed as ^[ by the TNC) and the command will be
lost.    We can work around this by sending a ^U or ^X first, to clear the junk
out.  It might also be a good idea to send an XON, in case the junk included an
XOFF.  So  we  send  ^Q^X^[JHOST1^M  (or,  if  you  prefer the ASCII mnemonics,
&lt;DC1&gt;&lt;CAN&gt;&lt;ESC&gt;JHOST1&lt;CR&gt;):</pre>

<pre>            11 18 1B 4A 48 4F 53 54 31 0D
            ^Q ^X ^[ J  H  O  S  T  1  CR</pre>

<pre>This will work every time, if the TNC is in user mode.  If the TNC is  in  Host
mode  already, we should detect that fact and recover.  Host mode recovery will
be discussed later in this document.</pre>

<pre>  Exiting Host mode is a simple matter of sending a JHOST0 command to the  TNC.
The  TNC  will  acknowledge  the  JHOST0 command in the usual Host-mode fashion
before  returning  to  user  mode,  so  you  can  use  your  regular  Host-mode
transaction routine.</pre>

<pre>  Note  that  a  QRES  command issued in Host mode will dump you back into user
mode.  It does not acknowledge in Host-mode fashion before doing so.  The  Host
mode  parameter  is not stored in NOVRAM, so it is not possible to &quot;wake up&quot; in
Host mode.  It is, however, possible to PERM other parameters from Host mode.

</pre>

<pre>                                   Chapter 3
                              Commanding the TNC
  OK, now that we're in Host mode, let's look at a simple command exchange.  We
will  gloss  over  some of the details for this first look.  Suppose we want to
turn off Unattended mode.  In normal user  mode,  we  would  type  &lt;ESC&gt;U0&lt;CR&gt;.
That  is,  we would send a U0 command to the TNC.  To send a U0 command in Host
mode, we have  to  assemble  a  transmission  for  the  TNC  according  to  the
computer-to-TNC format.</pre>

<pre>  Recall that the computer-to-TNC format is:</pre>

<pre>    {channel}{info/cmd}{count}{data...}</pre>

<pre>The  first  byte,  channel,  is  the  channel number.  In user mode, it doesn't
matter what channel you are on when you give a U command.   Likewise,  in  Host
mode,  it  doesn't matter which channel you send this command to.  Let's choose
channel 0.  The second byte is info/cmd; this is a command, so this byte has to
be  1.    The  command data we are going to send is simply &quot;U0&quot;, the same ASCII
string we would have used between &lt;ESC&gt; and &lt;CR&gt; to do the same thing  in  user
mode.    This  is  two bytes long, so the count byte should indicate two bytes.
Count is encoded as (length - 1), so the third byte of the  message  should  be
2 - 1 = 1.</pre>

<pre>  The  following is an illustration of the required transmission.  The top line
lists the bytes to be sent in hex notation.  The first  byte  sent  is  on  the
left.    Below  each byte of the top line is an explanation of that byte.  This
format  will  be  used  throughout  this  document  to  illustrate  Host   mode
transmissions.</pre>

<pre>            00 01 01 55 30
            !  !  !  U  0
            !  !  !
            !  !  +-- Count = 1    (two bytes)
            !  +----- Info/cmd = 1 (this is a command)
            +-------- Channel = 0</pre>

<pre>  Note  that  no  carriage  return is required or allowed.  As soon as the byte
count is fulfilled (i.e., when the last byte has been received) the TNC accepts
the transmission as complete.</pre>

<pre>  How do we know the TNC got the command OK?  Simple: it responds with a status
message.  A U0 command can't fail, so we can guess that the status message will
be  a success message.  A U0 command doesn't return any information, either, so
no data field will be present.  So, we can guess that the TNC will respond with
a transmission in the short format:</pre>

<pre>            00 00
            !  !
            !  +--- Code = 0 (Success, no data follows)
            +------ Channel 0</pre>

<pre>  Now  we  can  see  the  general  shape  of  any computer-TNC transaction: the
computer sends a command to the TNC, and the TNC responds with  an  appropriate
message.    In  writing  a program to interface with Host mode, we will have to
take care of building these  outgoing  frames  and  interpreting  the  incoming
frames.    If  we take a hint from WA8DED and W6IXU, we will implement a single
routine that does the dirty work of sending a transmission  and  receiving  the
response.</pre>

<pre>  In  receiving  the  response,  the  routine  will  have  to  decide  how many
characters to read from the serial port by looking at the code  in  the  second
byte of the TNC's message.  This code tells it in which format the transmission
will be: short format with no following data, null-terminated format with  some
data  ending  in  a  null,  or byte-count format with a count and the specified
number of bytes of information.</pre>

<pre>  Notice that the routine that receives the response doesn't have to  have  any
knowledge  of  the  current  state  of the TNC or the application program.  The
meaning and encoding of the TNC's response is completely determined by the data
in  that  response.   This simplifies the routine that receives the response by
isolating it from the complexities of the application program.

</pre>

<pre>                                   Chapter 4
                        Polling the TNC: the G command
  The most essential, basic transaction in Host mode is the  G  command,  which
polls  a  specific channel of the TNC for events and data.  A typical Host-mode
application program will constantly send G commands to the  TNC  and  interpret
the  responses.    Since  the G command is a query to a specific channel of the
TNC, it is necessary to send G commands to all of the channels that may  be  in
use.    Data  received from a station connected on channel 1 (or 2, or 3, or 4)
will be sent to the computer as a response to a G command directed to channel 1
(or 2, or 3, or 4).  Monitored data will be sent to the computer as a G command
directed to channel 0.</pre>

<pre>  The G command has three forms.  A command of  &quot;G&quot;  will  return  any  of  the
possible  responses  that  is  available.    A command of &quot;G0&quot; will return only
information.  A command of &quot;G1&quot; will return only link status responses.    This
is  useful  when  you  are  waiting for a link status change and do not wish to
handle data, or vice versa.</pre>

<pre>  The only other thing that changes in a G command is the channel number.    Be
sure  to send G commands to all channels that may be active.  You need not send
G commands to channel 4 if Y is 3, for instance, but you must send  G  commands
to  channels 0 through 3.  The unrestricted G command has the following format:</pre>

<pre>            0x 01 00 47
            !  !  !  G
            !  !  !
            !  !  +--- Count = 0    (one byte of data)
            !  +------ Info/cmd = 1 (this is a command)
            +--------- Channel = x  (where x is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4)</pre>

<pre>  There are only a few possible responses to a G command.  If the program polls
the  TNC  constantly  with  G  commands,  most  of the replies will be &quot;nothing
available&quot;.  This simply means nothing new has happened on the link  since  the
last  poll.   This response applies to any of the three forms of the G command.
Each of the other possible responses indicates an event on the AX.25 channel: a
change  in Link Status (such as &quot;DISCONNECTED&quot;), which is evoked by G or G1, or
receipt of a frame of monitored or connected data, which is evoked by G or  G0.
The  detailed  formats  of  these  responses  will  be  discussed later in this
document.</pre>

<pre>  Monitored information is handled specially by the G command.  Monitored  data
is  handled  on  channel  0  of  the  TNC.    The monitor header is transmitted
separately from the monitor  information.    The  monitor  header  transmission
indicates  whether  or  not  there is an associated information transmission to
come.  If there is, it will be the next response on channel 0.  This scheme has
two  results:  it  spares  the  programmer  the  task  of  parsing  out monitor
information from the monitor header (if such is  desired),  and  it  keeps  the
maximum  transmission  length  down to the maximum data field size, rather than
the data field size plus the monitor header size (and thus allows the count  to
be a single byte).</pre>

<pre>  This  scheme  for  monitored data might be considered a violation of the rule
that each computer-TNC transmission  is  self-contained  and  self-explanatory.
The   monitored  information  transmission  is  qualified  by  the  immediately
preceding monitor header transmission.  You many want to treat a monitor header
with  information  as  a  special case in the application program, and grab the
corresponding monitor information transmission immediately.

</pre>

<pre>                                   Chapter 5
                       Details of Computer-to-TNC Format
  As we said before, the computer-to-TNC transmissions must always follow  this
format:</pre>

<pre>    {channel}{info/cmd}{count}{data...}</pre>

<pre>  The  three  header  bytes  (channel,  info/cmd,  and  count) are expressed in
binary.  For instance, to specify 0 for any of these values, send a  NULL  (^^U,
'^Y0' for C fans, CHR$(0) for BASIC fans).  DON'T send the ASCII character '0'.</pre>

<pre>  The data field will contain one of the following:</pre>

<pre>   1. Data to be transmitted via the AX.25 link.</pre>

<pre>   2. A command string just like you might issue from the normal user mode
      (the part strictly between the &lt;ESC&gt; and the &lt;CR&gt;).</pre>

<pre>   3. &quot;G&quot;, the Host-mode poll command.</pre>

<pre>  If data for the AX.25 link is to be sent, the  info/cmd  byte  must  be  zero
(binary  zero,  remember, not ASCII &quot;0&quot;).  The data field may contain any bytes
whatsoever, but not more than 256 of  them.    Count  up  the  data  bytes  and
subtract one to find the value of the count byte.  So if you're connected to me
on channel 2, and you want to say</pre>

<pre>           Hello</pre>

<pre>to me, send the TNC this transmission:</pre>

<pre>            02 00 05 48 65 6C 6C 6F 0D
            !  !  !  H  e  l  l  o  CR
            !  !  !                 !
            !  !  !                 +---- (this is a data byte)
            !  !  +- Count = 5    (six bytes of data)
            !  +---- Info/cmd = 0 (this is information to be sent)
            +------- Channel = 2  (since I'm on your channel 2)</pre>

<pre>Note that the CR is sent as data, and will be  transmitted  through  the  AX.25
link.  It is not part of the transmission format.</pre>

<pre>  If  the  information  is  sent  to  channel  0, it will go out unproto to the
address on channel 0 (default CQ).  If information is sent on  channel  1  -  4
while that channel is not connected, it is ignored.</pre>

<pre>  If  a  command string is to be sent, the info/cmd byte must be one.  The data
field should contain the ASCII command string.  It does not  contain  &lt;ESC&gt;  or
&lt;CR&gt;, just the characters that would go between them to form a normal user-mode
command.  For instance, to set TXDELAY to 30, send the TNC this transmission:
</pre>

<pre>            00 01 02 54 33 30
            !  !  !  T  3  0
            !  !  !
            !  !  +- Count = 2    (three bytes of data)
            !  +---- Info/cmd = 1 (this is a command)
            +------- Channel = 0  (doesn't matter here)</pre>

<pre>  The channel number is significant for the  C,  D,  F,  G,  L,  N,  O,  and  V
commands.    C,  D, F, N, O, and V commands are channel specific in exactly the
same way as they are in user mode.  The L command is different  in  Host  mode,
and  will  be discussed later in this document.  The G command has already been
discussed.  The channel number is not significant for other commands.  You  may
use  whatever  channel  number  is  convenient.    (WA8DED and W6IXU send these
commands to channel 0).</pre>

<pre>  The byte-count format for the computer-to-TNC transmissions is  used  because
it  provides  &quot;data  transparency&quot;.    This means that any bytes whatsoever may
appear in the data field.  The TNC can just accept the next so many bytes  from
the  computer  without  thinking about it.  If a special character were used to
signal the end of the data, that character could not occur in the  data.    The
null-terminated  format  can  use  this  scheme,  since  the  data  in these is
guaranteed not to contain a null.</pre>

<pre>  Unfortunately, the byte-count scheme is not very robust.  If a  character  is
lost  or  a spurious character is inserted, the computer and TNC could stay out
of synch forever.  We must take pains to detect loss of synch  and  to  recover
from  the  fault.   Fortunately, the first byte of a transmission has only five
valid values (0-4) and the second byte has only two valid values (0 and 1),  so
it is possible to detect a loss of synchronization in most cases.  Timeouts can
also be used to detect synch failures.  Once the error is detected, recovery is
possible.  Host mode recovery will be discussed later in this document.

</pre>

<pre>                                   Chapter 6
                       Details of TNC-to-Computer Format
  The  TNC-to-computer  transmission  format is a bit more complicated than the
computer-to-TNC format.  The key to decoding a transmission from the TNC is the
code  byte that follows the channel number byte.  The following table gives the
code values:</pre>

<pre>                             TNC-TO-COMPUTER CODES</pre>

<pre>          Code Meaning                       Format
          ==== =======                       ======
          0    Success, nothing follows      short format
               (Nothing available)
          1    Success, message follows      null-terminated format
          2    Failure, message follows      null-terminated format
          3    Link status                   null-terminated format
          4    Monitor header/no info        null-terminated format
          5    Monitor header/info           null-terminated format
          6    Monitor information           byte-count format
          7    Connected information         byte-count format</pre>

<pre>  These various formats are used for different purposes.  Codes 0, 1, and 2 are
responses  to  an  information or command transmission from the computer.  If a
batch of information was queued for transmission successfully or if  a  command
completes successfully without returning any information, a code 0 transmission
will be the reply:</pre>

<pre>            02 00
            !  !
            !  +---- Code = 1    (Success, nothing follows)
            +------- Channel = 2 (same as the info or command sent)</pre>

<pre>If the command is successful and returns information (like any command  without
an  argument), a code 1 transmission will be the reply.  The returned data will
follow the code, &quot;null terminated&quot;.  This just means that a 0 byte will  appear
after the last information byte.  For example, consider an M command without an
argument.  In user mode, the user would type  &lt;ESC&gt;M&lt;CR&gt;,  and  the  TNC  would
display something like</pre>

<pre>    * IUSCRT *</pre>

<pre>In Host mode, the command would be</pre>

<pre>            00 01 00 4D
            !  !  !  M
            !  !  !
            !  !  +---- Count = 0    (one data byte)
            !  +------- Info/cmd = 1 (this is a command)
            +---------- Channel = 0  (Doesn't matter here)</pre>

<pre>and the response might be</pre>

<pre>            00 01 49 55 53 43 52 54 00
            !  !  I  U  S  C  R  T  !
            !  !                    +---- Null termination
            !  !
            !  +---- Code = 1    (Success with info)
            +------- Channel = 0 (same as in the query)</pre>

<pre>If  the command failed, or the information cannot be queued for transmission, a
code 2 transmission with one of these error messages will be the reply:</pre>

<pre>                               FAILURE MESSAGES</pre>

<pre>                                INVALID COMMAND
                            TNC BUSY - LINE IGNORED
                           CHANNEL ALREADY CONNECTED
                           STATION ALREADY CONNECTED</pre>

<pre>  For example if you send a data line:</pre>

<pre>            03 00 0C 48 65 6C 6C 6F 20 74 68 65 72 65 2E 0D
            !  !  !  H  e  l  l  o     t  h  e  r  e  .  CR
            !  !  !                                      !
            !  !  !            (this is a data byte) ----+
            !  !  +---- Count = 12   (thirteen data bytes)
            !  +------- Info/cmd = 0 (this is information)
            +---------- Channel = 3  (for instance)</pre>

<pre>when the TNC has no RAM available to buffer the data line, it will respond with
a code 2 failure message to inform you of the condition:</pre>

<pre>            03 02 544C432042555359202D204C494C452049474C4F524544 00
            !  !  T N C   B U S Y   -   L I N E   I G N O R E D  !
            !  !                                                 !
            !  +---- Code = 2 (Failure)      Null terminator ----+
            +------ Channel = 3 (same as the info sent)</pre>

<pre>If you send a bad command:</pre>

<pre>            00 01 03 4A 55 4C 4B
            !  !  !  J  U  N  K
            !  !  !
            !  !  +---- Count = 3    (four data bytes)
            !  +------- Info/cmd = 1 (this is a command)
            +---------- Channel = 0  (Doesn't matter here.)</pre>

<pre>It will complain about it with a code 2 failure message:</pre>

<pre>            00 02 49 4E 56 41 4C 49 44 20 43 4F 4D 4D 41 4E 44 00
            !  !  I  N  V  A  L  I  D     C  O  M  M  A  N  D  !
            !  !                                               !
            !  +---- Code = 2 (Failure)     Null termination --+
            +------- Channel = 0 (same as the command sent)</pre>

<pre>  The  remaining  codes,  3 through 7, are used only as responses to a &quot;G&quot; poll
command.  A 0 code can also be a response to a G poll.  A  0  code  means  that
nothing is available for that channel: that is, no events worthy of notice have
taken place on the channel polled.  This is the most common  response  to  a  G
command.</pre>

<pre>            0x 00
            !  !
            !  +---- Code = 0    (Nothing available)
            +------- Channel = x (same as the G command)</pre>

<pre>  A code of 3 signifies a Link Status message.  These messages are:</pre>

<pre>                             LINK STATUS MESSAGES</pre>

<pre>               ({n}) BUSY fm {call} via {digipeaters}
               ({n}) CONNECTED to {call} via {digipeaters}
               ({n}) LINK RESET fm {call} via {digipeaters}
               ({n}) LINK RESET to {call} via {digipeaters}
               ({n}) DISCONNECTED fm {call} via {digipeaters}
               ({n}) LINK FAILURE with {call} via {digipeaters}
               CONNECT REQUEST fm {call} via {digipeaters}
               ({n}) FRAME REJECT (x y z) fm {call} via {digipeaters}
               ({n}) FRAME REJECT (x y z) to {call} via {digipeaters}</pre>

<pre>  These messages should look familiar, since they are identical to the messages
displayed by the TNC in user mode.  {n} is the channel number.  Notice that the
channel number in the message is redundant information.  The channel number may
be omitted from this message in a future release.</pre>

<pre>  For instance, if I connect to you direct on channel 2, a poll  of  channel  2
(not  necessarily the next one, depending on what else is going on) will return
the event:</pre>

<pre>         02 03 28322920434F4E4E454354454420746F204B42354D55 00
         !  !  ( 2 )   C O N N E C T E D   t o   K B 5 M U  !
         !  !                                               !
         !  +---- Code = 3 (Link Status) Null termination --+
         +------- Channel = 2</pre>

<pre>  Codes of 4 and 5 both signify a monitor header.  This  is  a  null-terminated
format message containing the</pre>

<pre>    fm {call} to {call} via {digipeaters} ctl {name} pid {hex}</pre>

<pre>string  that  forms  a monitor header.  The monitor header is also identical to
the monitor header displayed in user mode.  If the code was  4,  the  monitored
frame contained no information field, so the monitor header is all you get.  If
you monitor KB6C responding to a connect request from me and then poll  channel
0, you'll get:</pre>

<pre>    0004666D204B42364320746F204B42354D552063746C2055612070494420463000
    ! ! f m   K B 6 C   t o   K B 5 M U   c t l   U A   p i d   F 0 !
    ! !                                                             !
    ! +---- Code = 4 (Monitor, no info)        Null termination ----+
    +------- Channel = 0 (Monitor info is always on channel 0)</pre>

<pre>  If  the code was 5, the monitored frame did contain an information field.  In
this case, another G command to channel 0 will return the monitored information
with  a code of 6.  Since data transmissions must be transparent, the monitored
information is passed as a byte-count format transmission.    That  is,  it  is
preceded  by a count byte (one less than the number of bytes in the field).  No
null terminator is used in this case.  Since codes  4,  5,  and  6  pertain  to
monitored  information,  they will be seen only on channel 0.  If you hear KB6C
say &quot;Hi&quot; to NK6K, and then poll channel 0, you'll get:</pre>

<pre>    0005666D204B42364320746F204E4B364B2063746C204930302070494420463000

    ! !                           or whatever ----+-+               !
    ! !                                                             !
    ! +---- Code = 5 (Monitor, info follows)   Null termination ----+
    +------ Channel = 0 (Monitor info is always on channel 0)</pre>

<pre>and then the very next poll to channel 0 will get:</pre>

<pre>         00 06 02 48 69 0D
         !  !  !  H  i  CR
         !  !  !        !
         !  !  !        +----    (this is a data byte)
         !  !  +---- Count = 2   (three bytes of data)
         !  +------- Code = 6    (monitored information)
         +---------- Channel = 0 (Monitor info is always on channel 0)</pre>

<pre>  A code of 7 signifies connected information, so it will only  be  seen  on  a
connected  channel  1  through  4.  It is a byte-count format transmission, for
data transparency.  If you're connected to me on channel 4 and I  say  &quot;Hi&quot;,  a
poll of channel 4 will return:</pre>

<pre>            04 07 02 48 69 0D
            !  !  !  H  i  CR
            !  !  !        !
            !  !  !        +----    (this is a data byte)
            !  !  +---- Count = 2   (three bytes of data)
            !  +------- Code = 7    (connected information)
            +---------- Channel = 4 (info was received on channel 4)

</pre>

                    Querying Channel Status: the L command
  One  of the most powerful features of the Host mode is the ability to ask the
TNC for a status report on a given channel.  This  report  is  similar  to  the
report  given by the L command in user mode, but more extensive.  To obtain the
Channel Status report, send an L command to the channel of interest.   The  TNC
will  (barring  error)  respond with a code 1 packet.  The information field of
this packet will contain six decimal number in ASCII delimited by spaces.</pre>

<pre>  A typical Channel Status query:</pre>

<pre>            01 01 00 4C
            !  !  !  L
            !  !  !
            !  !  +---- Count = 0    (one data byte)
            !  +------- Info/cmd = 1 (this is a command)
            +---------- Channel = 1  (give me a report on channel 1)</pre>

<pre>A typical Channel Status report:</pre>

<pre>            01 01 30 20 30 20 30 20 30 20 30 20 30 00
            !  !  0     0     0     0     0     0  !
            !  !                                   !
            !  !              null termination ----+
            !  +------- Code = 1    (Success with info)
            +---------- Channel = 1 (this is a report on channel 1)</pre>

<pre>  Channel 0 does not have as much state information as  a  regular  connectable
channel, so a Channel Status query to channel 0:</pre>

<pre>            00 01 00 4C
            !  !  !  L
            !  !  !
            !  !  +---- Count = 0    (one data byte)
            !  +------- Info/cmd = 1 (this is a command)
            +---------- Channel = 0  (give me a report on channel 0)</pre>

<pre>Will return a Channel Status report similar to this one.</pre>

<pre>            00 01 30 20 33 00
            !  !  0     3  !
            !  !           !
            !  !           +---- null termination
            !  +------- Code = 1    (Success with info)
            +---------- Channel = 0 (this is a report on channel 0)</pre>

<pre>  The interpretation of the returned information is as follows:
</pre>

<pre>                             CHANNEL STATUS FORMAT</pre>

<pre>          a b c d e f
          a = Number of link status messages not yet displayed
          b = Number of receive frames not yet displayed
          c = Number of send frames not yet transmitted
          d = Number of transmitted frames not yet acknowledged
          e = Number of tries on current operation
          f = Link state</pre>

<pre>              Possible link states are:
               0 = Disconnected
               1 = Link Setup
               2 = Frame Reject
               3 = Disconnect Request
               4 = Information Transfer
               5 = Reject Frame Sent
               6 = Waiting Acknowledgement
               7 = Device Busy
               8 = Remote Device Busy
               9 = Both Devices Busy
              10 = Waiting Acknowledgement and Device Busy
              11 = Waiting Acknowledgement and Remote Busy
              12 = Waiting Acknowledgement and Both Devices Busy
              13 = Reject Frame Sent and Device Busy
              14 = Reject Frame Sent and Remote Busy
              15 = Reject Frame Sent and Both Devices Busy</pre>

<pre>          NOTE 1:  Only items a and b are displayed for channel 0.
          NOTE 2:  Only states 0 - 4 are possible if version 1 is in use.
</pre>

<pre>  How  you  will use the Channel Status report will depend on your application.
An interactive terminal program  might  simply  display  some  or  all  of  the
information and leave it at that.  A mailbox program might want to wait for all
packets  to  be  acknowledged  before  starting  a  timeout  timer  or   before
disconnecting.    A  mail  forwarder  would  want  to  make  sure  all data was
acknowledged before considering its task done.  Any program might want to  give
up  if  throughput is too low.  These functions are easy to implement with Host
mode.

                           Host Mode Error Recovery
  What happens if something goes wrong on the computer-TNC link?   Maybe  there
is  a  loose  wire,  or  maybe  RF  got into the RS-232 lines.  Maybe it's just
Murphy.  For whatever reason, the data on the line got corrupted.  RS-232 links
are  very  reliable, so you may never see an error, but the application program
should be ready to cope with one.</pre>

<pre>  The error recovery program must assume  that  the  TNC  is  in  a  completely
unknown state.  It might be expecting more bytes to fill a byte count (if bytes
coming from the computer were  lost).    It  might  be  simply  waiting  for  a
transmission,  but  the computer thought there was an error since data was lost
or corrupted on its way from the TNC.  What we want to do is hit the TNC with a
stream  of  data that will eventually bring it into a known state.  Preferably,
this process should generate little or no spurious data on the AX.25 link.</pre>

<pre>  The first thing to do is dump any further data that may be  coming  from  the
TNC.  We don't know what it is, and so we can't use it.  The possibility exists
that this is connected information we're dropping on the floor.  This  is  just
too bad.  There is nothing we can do.</pre>

<pre>  Next,  we just send ^A's one at a time until the TNC responds.  The first few
^A's may go to fulfill a byte count that the TNC  is  waiting  for.    If  this
happens  to  be a connected information transmission, these ^A's will go out on
the AX.25 link. Tough.  When any outstanding byte count is fulfilled  (no  more
than 256 should be required), the following five ^A's will be seen as a command
on channel 1.  This is why ^A is chosen: to make the TNC  interpret  the  extra
transmission as a command.</pre>

<pre>            01 01 01 01 01
            !  !  !  ^A ^A
            !  !  !
            !  !  +-- Count of two bytes.
            !  +----- This is a command.
            +-------- Channel #1.</pre>

<pre>A  command  of  &quot;^A^A&quot;  doesn't mean anything, so the TNC should respond with a
failure message:</pre>

<pre>            01 02 49 4E 56 41 4C 49 44 20 43 4F 4D 4D 41 4E 44 00
            !  !  I  N  V  A  L  I  D     C  O  M  M  A  N  D  !
            !  !                                               !
            !  +---- Failure message.       Null termination --+
            +------- Same channel as the command specified</pre>

<pre>We don't really care what the response is, though.  It may not be exactly  what
we  expect.    For  instance,  the  first  ^A might fulfill the byte count of a
garbled command.  This would usually generate an error message  of  some  other
type.   All we need is to get the first response.  Then we know that the TNC is
waiting for a command.</pre>

<pre>  This implies that we have to wait between ^A's long enough to see if there is
a  response yet.  This can make the recovery process a slow one.  For instance,
if the TNC spuriously receives 00 00 FF, it  expects  to  see  256  data  bytes
following,  so  we  will  have to send 256 ^A's before we get a response (which
will probably be a success message, since this is just a data  transmission  to
the TNC).  Fortunately, this error recovery process is not required very often.</pre>
